# AOC2025-Solutions

This repository contains my **Advent of Code 2025** solutions.  

**Goals for this year:**
- ✅ Complete **all puzzles** from AOC 2025  
- ✅ Solve every problem using **only standard Python libraries** (with **one exception**: Day 11 uses `z3-solver`)  

All solutions are written in **clean, Pythonic code**, making this repo a great reference for learning efficient problem-solving techniques and leveraging Python’s built-in tools.
